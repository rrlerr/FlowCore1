You are a full-stack AI developer building a powerful all-in-one business management app called FlowCore.

It is a modern, web-based SaaS platform built using full-stack technologies (React + Tailwind + Node.js + Express + MongoDB or fallback mock DB). The app is modular and includes the following modules:

‚úÖ CORE MODULES TO BUILD COMPLETELY:

1. CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
   - Add, edit, view, delete leads and clients
   - Assign tags, status, contact history, priority
   - Sort, filter, and search leads

2. Sales & Revenue
   - Track deals, revenue sources, and pipeline stages
   - Create custom reports (monthly, quarterly)
   - Visual charts (bar, pie, line) to show sales progress

3. Support / Ticketing System
   - Add ticket (MUST open a form to ask user for ticket title, description, priority, etc.)
   - View all tickets by status (open, pending, resolved)
   - Assign to team members
   - Filter and search tickets

4. Projects & Task Management
   - Create projects with deadlines, owners, priority
   - Add subtasks and checklists
   - Show progress visually
   - Kanban-style board for task movement (optional)

5. Email & Communication
   - Send emails to leads or customers
   - Store communication history per contact
   - Use SMTP (mock or real)

‚úÖ FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT):

- All modules must be **fully functional**, not just UI.
- ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù buttons must **open modals or forms** to collect user input.
- All modals/forms must save to in-memory state or backend.
- Tabs and buttons should be fully connected to their functions.
- Do NOT use placeholders or stub functions.
- If MongoDB is not available, use a JSON file or temporary in-memory DB.

ü§ñ BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT INSIDE THE APP:

Build an **AI assistant** that behaves just like ChatGPT, integrated visually inside the app as a floating or fixed chat window.

It should:
- Accept **free-form natural language**, not fixed commands
- Respond to any request like:
  - ‚ÄúCreate a new ticket about password reset‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúShow me sales from April‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúFix the leads tab ‚Äî it‚Äôs not working‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúMake a bar chart comparing Q1 and Q2‚Äù
- Understand and trigger actual app functions (fuzzy matching or intent recognition)
- Auto-suggest fixes or explain errors when things fail
- Generate custom charts from app data using Chart.js or Recharts
- Handle data lookup, navigation, record creation, and updates
- Auto-correct user typos if possible

üì¶ Folder Structure Example:

- `/frontend`
  - React + Tailwind UI
  - Pages for each module
  - Components for modals, charts, tables
  - AI Assistant UI (chatbox-style)
- `/backend`
  - Express.js API
  - Routes for CRM, Sales, Tickets, Projects
  - Email via Nodemailer (optional)
- `/utils`
  - App state manager
  - AI helper for interpreting user intent

---

üéØ KEY PRIORITY:
- Fix all previous issues:
  - "Add Ticket" not opening form
  - Tabs not working or loading
  - AI only responding to rigid phrases
- All actions must be functional, not just visual

---

üèÅ GOAL: Build FlowCore ‚Äî a full SaaS business platform with functional modules, intelligent natural-language AI assistant, and fully working tabs, forms, and interactions.

This should be built or repaired now, within token and runtime limits.
